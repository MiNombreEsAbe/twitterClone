## What Is This Project
This is a simple Twitter clone. The purpose of this project is to practice what I have been learning and build up my portfolio. Also, if you would like, you can fork this repository, and make it your own.

## How To Use
To post, you should fill out the name and message field. If you want, you can add an image. Once you are happy with your post, you can click the "Tweet" button. As of right now, there aren't users, so anyone can edit or delete any post. To do so, click on the three dots icon at the top right of any post.
